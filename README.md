## Description
Project 2: Setting up a password generator.

## Details for teaching team
The live site is running on Pagodabox this time around. 
I used PHP to generate the form fields so that the page would hold onto it's selected values after submitting. 
I wasn't able to figure out how <pre>preg_match_all()</pre> is supposed to work, so I built a FOR loop that populates an ARRAY with the words from one of the pages at www.paulnoll.com. 
I've also used some jQuery to hide the capitalization options when using camel case.
